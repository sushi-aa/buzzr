# BUZZR
/* Buzzr is a website that combines Tinder, Buzzfeed, and LinkedIn. It is a female-centric website developed mostly 
to allow women in STEM to match with mentors, or just people (mostly women) in similar fields as them. We match the user with
a person who is most similar to them and person least similar to them, in order to encourage interaction with both like-minded 
people, as well as people who think very differently. Our users take a ten question quiz with questions that help us 
determine who the best match for our user would be. Then, our user is also stored in the database, allowing people to match
with them as well. This creates a huge potential for networking and connection, the building of a community centered mainly
around women in STEM */

-We used firebase to store our data, html, css, and JQuery for the frontent, and JavaScript and Node.js for our Backend.
